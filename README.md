# Adventures-of-Alfred
A 2D platformer prototype. Adventures of Alfred never made it to publishing, but I built in several prefabs that can be used in a 2D game. The game is almost complete, there are several enemies and different type of attacks they can perform, these enemies are also smart enough to find a valid path to the main character Alfred.
